This repository documents my personal journey learning penetration testing through Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.

The goal of the repo is to track my progress, document my thought process, improve my skills and to build good habits for real-world pentesting.


-- DISCLAIMER --

All machines and challenges documented here were intentionally vulnerable, solved in isolated lab environments and used for educational purposes only.

DO NOT ATTEMPT THESE TECHNIQUES ON SYSTEMS YOU DO NOT OWN OR HAVE EXPLICIT PERMISSION TO TEST.


Each box will contain scan results, enumeration notes, exploitation steps and the lessons I have learned.

I'll try to follow a structured approach:

  1. Enumeration first

  2. Identify attack surface
     
  3. Look for misconfigurations or known vulnerabilities
     
  4. Attempt exploitation
     
  5. Privilege escalation (if necessary)
      
  6. Post-exploitation & cleanup


If I get stuck, I may consult hints or partial walkthroughs, but only after significant effort. (pinkie promise)

My progress and learning goals are:

  1. Improve at enumeration
     
  2. Reduce reliance on walkthroughs
     
  3. Understand why exploits work, not just how
     
  4. Gradually increase the difficulty


-- NOTE --

This repository reflects learning in progress.

Mistakes, inefficiencies, and missed paths are part of the journey.

Also: if you have any tips, study guides or whatever that you recommend, please tell me!
